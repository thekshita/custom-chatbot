**India** , officially the **Republic of India** (ISO: _Bhārat
Gaṇarājya_),[22] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country
by area; the most populous country as of June 2023;[23][24] and from the time
of its independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy.[25][26][27]
Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest,
and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan
to the west;[j] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and
Myanmar[k] to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri
Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime
border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.

Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than
55,000 years ago.[28][29][30] Their long occupation, initially in varying
forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse,
second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[31] Settled life emerged on
the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years
ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third
millennium BCE.[32] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European
language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[33][34] Its evidence
today is found in the hymns of the _Rigveda_. Preserved by an oral tradition
that was resolutely vigilant, the _Rigveda_ records the dawning of Hinduism in
India.[35] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern
and western regions.[36] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had
emerged within Hinduism,[37] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming
social orders unlinked to heredity.[38] Early political consolidations gave
rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[39]
Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[40] but also
marked by the declining status of women,[41] and the incorporation of
untouchability into an organised system of belief.[l][42] In South India, the
Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to
the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[43]

In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism
became established on India's southern and western coasts.[44] Muslim armies
from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains,[45]
eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the
cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[46] In the 15th century, the
Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south
India.[47] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised
religion.[48] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative
peace,[49] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[m][50] Gradually
expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into
a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[51] British Crown
rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted
slowly,[52][53] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of
education and the public life took root.[54] A pioneering and influential
nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and
became the major factor in ending British rule.[55][56] In 1947 the British
Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[57][58][59][60]
a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan,
amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[61]

India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic
parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic
society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to almost 1.4
billion in 2022.[62] During the same time, its nominal per capita income
increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to
74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[63] India has
become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology
services, with an expanding middle class.[64] India has a space programme with
several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music,
and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[65] India
has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of
increasing economic inequality.[66] India is a nuclear-weapon state, which
ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its
neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[67]
Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child
malnutrition,[68] and rising levels of air pollution.[69] India's land is
megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[70] Its forest cover comprises
21.7% of its area.[71] India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed
with tolerance in India's culture,[72] is supported among these forests, and
elsewhere, in protected habitats.

According to the _Oxford English Dictionary_ (third edition 2009), the name
"India" is derived from the Classical Latin _India_ , a reference to South
Asia and an uncertain region to its east. In turn the name "India" derived
successively from Hellenistic Greek _India_ (_Ἰνδία_), ancient Greek _Indos_
(_Ἰνδός_), Old Persian _Hindush_ (an eastern province of the Achaemenid
Empire), and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit _Sindhu_ , or "river",
specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern
basin.[73][74] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as _Indoi_
(_Ἰνδοί_), which translates as "The people of the Indus".[75]

The term _Bharat_ (_Bhārat_ ; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] ⓘ), mentioned in both
Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[76][77] is used in its
variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name
_Bharatavarsha_ , which applied originally to North India,[78][79] _Bharat_
gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for
India.[76][80]

_Hindustan_ ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] ⓘ) is a Middle Persian name for India that became
popular by the 13th century,[81] and was used widely since the era of the
Mughal Empire. The meaning of _Hindustan_ has varied, referring to a region
encompassing present-day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near
entirety.[76][80][82]

### Ancient India

About 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or _Homo sapiens_ , had
arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier
evolved.[28][29][30] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia
date to about 30,000 years ago.[28] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication
of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage
of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan,
Pakistan.[84] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley
Civilisation,[85][84] the first urban culture in South Asia,[86] which
flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.[87] Centred
around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and
relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in
crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[86]

During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned
from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[88] The Vedas, the oldest
scriptures associated with Hinduism,[89] were composed during this period,[90]
and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab
region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[88] Most historians also consider this
period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the
subcontinent from the north-west.[89] The caste system, which created a
hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded
indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this
period.[91] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period
suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[88] In
South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number
of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[92] as well as by nearby
traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[92]

In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and
chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated
into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the
_mahajanapadas_.[93][94] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic
religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came
into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[95] Buddhism, based
on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social
classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was
central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[96][97][98] In an age
of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an
ideal,[99] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically,
by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other
states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[100] The empire was once thought to
have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core
regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous
areas.[101][102] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building
and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of
militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist _dhamma_.[103][104]

The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and
200 CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the
Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West
and Southeast Asia.[105][106] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal
control within the family, leading to increased subordination of
women.[107][100] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a
complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain;
this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[108][109] Under the
Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of
ritual, began to assert itself.[110] This renewal was reflected in a flowering
of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[109]
Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy,
medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[109]

### Medieval India

The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional
kingdoms and cultural diversity.[111] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much
of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards,
he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[112] When his successor
attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of
Bengal.[112] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were
defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the
Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[112] No ruler of this period
was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their
core region.[111] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been
cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated
within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[113] The
caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[113]

In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the
Tamil language.[114] They were imitated all over India and led to both the
resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the
subcontinent.[114] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they
patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became
economic hubs as well.[115] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear
everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[115] By the 8th and 9th
centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast Asia, as South Indian culture
and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day
Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and
Indonesia.[116] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved
in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the initiative as well, with many
sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into
their languages.[116]

After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse
cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly
overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the
establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[117] The sultanate was
to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India.
Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left
its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[118][119]
By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate
saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the
scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics,
traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby
creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[120][121] The
sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India
paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[122] Embracing a strong
Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate,
the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[123] and was to influence
South Indian society for long afterwards.[122]

### Early modern India

In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim
rulers,[124] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new
generation of Central Asian warriors.[125] The resulting Mughal Empire did not
stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and
pacified them through new administrative practices[126][127] and diverse and
inclusive ruling elites,[128] leading to more systematic, centralised, and
uniform rule.[129] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially
under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty,
expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine
status.[128] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from
agriculture[130] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver
currency,[131] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[129] The
relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a
factor in India's economic expansion,[129] resulting in greater patronage of
painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[132] Newly coherent
social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the
Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal
rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition
and military experience.[133] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise
to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and
eastern India.[133] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were
able to seek and control their own affairs.[134]

IV, King"

By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political
dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies,
including the English East India Company, had established coastal
outposts.[135][136] The East India Company's control of the seas, greater
resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to
increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive
to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the
company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other
European companies.[137][135][138][139] Its further access to the riches of
Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it
to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[140] India was then no longer
exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the
British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the
onset of India's colonial period.[135] By this time, with its economic power
severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made
an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more
consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform,
and culture.[141]

### Modern India

Main article: History of the Republic of India

Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and
1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the
East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state.
These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the
surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological
changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not
long after their introduction in Europe.[142][143][144][145] However,
disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the
Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions,
including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary
treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many
regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company
rule.[146][147] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the
dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India
by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but
limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected
princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future
unrest.[148][149] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all
over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress
in 1885.[150][151][152][153]

The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second
half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks, and many small
farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[154] There was an
increase in the number of large-scale famines,[155] and, despite the risks of
infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial
employment was generated for Indians.[156] There were also salutary effects:
commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased
food production for internal consumption.[157] The railway network provided
critical famine relief,[158] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[158]
and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[157]

After World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[159] a
new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive
legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the
beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mahatma
Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol.[160] During the 1930s,
slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National
Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[161] The next decade was
beset with crises: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress's final
push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were
capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of
India into two states: India and Pakistan.[162]

Vital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution,
completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic.[163]
Per the London Declaration, India retained its membership of the Commonwealth,
becoming the first republic within it.[164] Economic liberalisation, which
began in the 1980s and the collaboration with Soviet Union for technical know-
how,[165] has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one
of the world's fastest-growing economies,[166] and increased its geopolitical
clout. Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural
and urban;[167] by religious and caste-related violence;[168] by Maoist-
inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[169] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir
and in Northeast India.[170] It has unresolved territorial disputes with
China[171] and with Pakistan.[171] India's sustained democratic freedoms are
unique among the world's newer nations; however, in spite of its recent
economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains
a goal yet to be achieved.[172]

## Geography

Main article: Geography of India

India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian
tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate.[173] India's defining
geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then
part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift
caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-
east.[173] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast,
began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.[173] These dual processes, driven
by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused
the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift
the Himalayas.[173] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate
movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-
borne sediment[174] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[175] The
original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the
ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly
direction. To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is
checked by the Aravallis.[176][177][178]

The Tungabhadra, with rocky outcrops, flows into the peninsular Krishna
river.[179]

The remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and
geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura
and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the
Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau
in Jharkhand in the east.[180] To the south, the remaining peninsular
landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal
ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats;[181] the plateau contains the
country's oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted
in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35°
30′ north latitude[n] and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude.[182]

India's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this
distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094
kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island
chains.[183] According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland
coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores,
including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.[183]

Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include
the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of
Bengal.[184] Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the
Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt
deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes.[185][186] Major
peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding,
include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also
drain into the Bay of Bengal;[187] and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain
into the Arabian Sea.[188] Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch
of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the
latter is shared with Bangladesh.[189] India has two archipelagos: the
Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and
Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.[190]

Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert,
both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter
monsoons.[191] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from
blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most
locations at similar latitudes.[192][193] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role
in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between
June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.[191] Four major
climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry,
subtropical humid, and montane.[194]

Temperatures in India have risen by 0.7 °C (1.3 °F) between 1901 and
2018.[195] Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause. The
retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the
major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.[196]
According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in
India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century.[197]

## Biodiversity

Main articles: Forestry in India and Wildlife of India

India is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries which display
high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or
endemic, to them.[198] India is a habitat for 8.6% of all mammal species,
13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2%
of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species.[199][200] Fully a
third of Indian plant species are endemic.[201] India also contains four of
the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots,[70] or regions that display significant
habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.[o][202]

According to official statistics, India's forest cover is 713,789 km2 (275,595
sq mi), which is 21.71% of the country's total land area.[71] It can be
subdivided further into broad categories of _canopy density_ , or the
proportion of the area of a forest covered by its tree canopy.[203] _Very
dense forest_ , whose _canopy density_ is greater than 70%, occupies 3.02% of
India's land area.[203][204] It predominates in the tropical moist forest of
the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and Northeast India. _Moderately dense
forest_ , whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of
India's land area.[203][204] It predominates in the temperate coniferous
forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous _sal_ forest of eastern India,
and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India.[205] _Open
forest_ , whose canopy density is between 10% and 40%, occupies 9.26% of
India's land area.[203][204] India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one
in the Deccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in
the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural
land by irrigation, its features no longer visible.[206]

Among the Indian subcontinent's notable indigenous trees are the astringent
_Azadirachta indica_ , or _neem_ , which is widely used in rural Indian herbal
medicine,[207] and the luxuriant _Ficus religiosa_ , or _peepul_ ,[208] which
is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro,[209] and under which the
Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.[210]

Many Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern
supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years
ago.[211] India's subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of
species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction
of many endemic Indian forms.[212] Still later, mammals entered India from
Asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the Himalayas.[213] This had
the effect of lowering endemism among India's mammals, which stands at 12.6%,
contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.[200] Among
endemics are the vulnerable[214] hooded leaf monkey[215] and the
threatened[216] Beddome's toad[216][217] of the Western Ghats.

India contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of
endangered forms.[218] These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the
Ganges river dolphin. Critically endangered species include the gharial, a
crocodilian; the great Indian bustard; and the Indian white-rumped vulture,
which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-
treated cattle.[219] Before they were extensively used for agriculture and
cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at
intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck
preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab,
is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct.[220] The
pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades
has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national
parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was expanded
substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act[221] and
Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was
enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988.[222] India hosts more than five
hundred wildlife sanctuaries and eighteen biosphere reserves,[223] four of
which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; seventy-five
wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.[224]

## Politics and government

### Politics

Main article: Politics of India

As part of Janadesh 2007, 25,000 pro-land reform landless people in Madhya
Pradesh listen to Rajagopal P. V.[226]

A parliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[227] India has six
recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress (INC) and
the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 50 regional parties.[228] The
Congress is considered centre in Indian political culture,[229] and the BJP
right-wing.[230][231][232] For most of the period between 1950—when India
first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in
the Parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political
stage with the BJP,[233] as well as with powerful regional parties which have
often forced the creation of multi-party coalition governments at the
centre.[234] India was 2023 the 19th most electoral democratic country in Asia
according to the V-Dem Democracy indices .[235]

In the Republic of India's first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and
1962, the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru's
death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was
succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Nehru's daughter Indira
Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and
1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in
1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new Janata Party,
which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over
two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; Morarji Desai
and Charan Singh. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in
leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by
her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections later
that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front
coalition, led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front,
won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting
just under two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; V.P.
Singh and Chandra Shekhar.[236] Elections were held again in 1991; no party
won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able
to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.[237]

US president Barack Obama addresses the members of the Parliament of India in
New Delhi in November 2010.

A two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996.
Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a
government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting
United Front coalitions, which depended on external support. There were two
prime ministers during this period; H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral. In 1998,
the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic
Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-
Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term.[238] Again in the
2004 Indian general elections, no party won an absolute majority, but the
Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful
coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-
leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the
2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required
external support from India's communist parties.[239] That year, Manmohan
Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962
to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.[240] In the 2014 general
election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a
majority and govern without the support of other parties.[241] In the 2019
general election, the BJP was victorious again. The incumbent prime minister
is Narendra Modi, a former chief minister of Gujarat. On 22 July 2022,
Droupadi Murmu was elected India's 15th president and took the oath of office
on 25 July 2022.[242]

### Government

Main articles: Government of India and Constitution of India

Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India, was
designed by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker for the Viceroy
of India, and constructed between 1911 and 1931 during the British Raj.[243]

India is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the
Constitution of India—the country's supreme legal document. It is a
constitutional republic.

Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the
states. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January
1950,[244] originally stated India to be a "sovereign, democratic republic;"
this characterisation was amended in 1971 to "a sovereign, socialist, secular,
democratic republic".[245] India's form of government, traditionally described
as "quasi-federal" with a strong centre and weak states,[246] has grown
increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic,
and social changes.[247][248]

The Government of India comprises three branches:[252]

  * Executive: The President of India is the ceremonial head of state,[253] who is elected indirectly for a five-year term by an electoral college comprising members of national and state legislatures.[254][255] The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and exercises most executive power.[256] Appointed by the president,[257] the prime minister is by convention supported by the party or political alliance having a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.[256] The executive of the Indian government consists of the president, the vice-president, and the Union Council of Ministers—with the cabinet being its executive committee—headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament.[253] In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament. Civil servants act as permanent executives and all decisions of the executive are implemented by them.[258]
  * Legislature: The legislature of India is the bicameral parliament. Operating under a Westminster-style parliamentary system, it comprises an upper house called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of the People).[259] The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245 members who serve staggered six-year terms.[260] Most are elected indirectly by the state and union territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population.[257] All but two of the Lok Sabha's 545 members are elected directly by popular vote; they represent single-member constituencies for five-year terms.[261] Two seats of parliament, reserved for Anglo-Indians in the article 331, have been scrapped.[262][263]
  * Judiciary: India has a three-tier unitary independent judiciary[264] comprising the supreme court, headed by the Chief Justice of India, 25 high courts, and a large number of trial courts.[264] The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has appellate jurisdiction over the high courts.[265] It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution[266] and invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional.[267]

### Administrative divisions

Main article: Administrative divisions of India

See also: Political integration of India

India is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories.[14] All
states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and
the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and
governments following the Westminster system of governance. The remaining five
union territories are directly ruled by the central government through
appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states
were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[268] There are over a quarter of a
million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village
levels.[269]

## Foreign, economic and strategic relations

Main articles: Foreign relations of India and Indian Armed Forces

During the 1950s and 60s, India played a pivotal role in the Non-Aligned
Movement.[270] From left to right: Gamal Abdel Nasser of United Arab Republic
(now Egypt), Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia and Jawaharlal Nehru in Belgrade,
September 1961.

In the 1950s, India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and
played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement.[271] After initially
cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went to war with China in
1962 and was widely thought to have been humiliated.[272] This was followed by
another military conflict in 1967 in which India successfully repelled Chinese
attack.[273] India has had tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan; the two
nations have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three of
these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the
third, the 1971 war, followed from India's support for the independence of
Bangladesh.[274] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened
abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri
Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup
d'état attempt in the Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began
to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late
1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[275]

Aside from its ongoing special relationship with Russia,[276] India has wide-
ranging defence relations with Israel and France. In recent years, it has
played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and
the World Trade Organization. The nation has provided 100,000 military and
police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four
continents. It participates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and other
multilateral forums.[277] India has close economic ties with countries in
South America,[278] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a "Look East" policy that
seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations, Japan, and South
Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic
investment and regional security.[279][280]

parade in Paris, on 14 July 2009. The parade at which India was the foreign
guest was led by India's oldest regiment, the Maratha Light Infantry, founded
in 1768.[281]

China's nuclear test of 1964, as well as its repeated threats to intervene in
support of Pakistan in the 1965 war, convinced India to develop nuclear
weapons.[282] India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and
carried out additional underground testing in 1998. Despite criticism and
military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be
flawed and discriminatory.[283] India maintains a "no first use" nuclear
policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its "Minimum
Credible Deterrence" doctrine.[284][285] It is developing a ballistic missile
defence shield and, a fifth-generation fighter jet.[286][287] Other indigenous
military projects involve the design and implementation of _Vikrant_ -class
aircraft carriers and _Arihant_ -class nuclear submarines.[288]

Since the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic,
and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union.[289]
In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United
States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a
party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the
International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending
earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a
consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state.[290] India
subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy
with Russia,[291] France,[292] the United Kingdom,[293] and Canada.[294]

The President of India is the supreme commander of the nation's armed forces;
with 1.45 million active troops, they compose the world's second-largest
military. It comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force,
and the Indian Coast Guard.[295] The official Indian defence budget for 2011
was US$36.03 billion, or 1.83% of GDP.[296] Defence expenditure was pegged at
US$70.12 billion for fiscal year 2022–23 and, increased 9.8% than previous
fiscal year.[297][298] India is the world's second-largest arms importer;
between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total global arms
imports.[299] Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against
Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.[300] In
May 2017, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched the South Asia
Satellite, a gift from India to its neighbouring SAARC countries.[301] In
October 2018, India signed a US$5.43 billion (over ₹400 billion) agreement
with Russia to procure four S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile defence
systems, Russia's most advanced long-range missile defence system.[302]

## Economy

Main article: Economy of India

A farmer in northwestern Karnataka ploughs his field with a tractor even as
another in a field beyond does the same with a pair of oxen. In 2019, 43% of
India's total workforce was employed in agriculture.[303]

India is the world's largest producer of milk, with the largest population of
cattle. In 2018, nearly 80% of India's milk was sourced from small farms with
herd size between one and two, the milk harvested by hand milking.[305]

Women tend to a recently planted rice field in Junagadh district in Gujarat.
55% of India's female workforce was employed in agriculture in 2019.[304]

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2022
was nominally worth $3.46 trillion; it was the fifth-largest economy by market
exchange rates and is, around $11.6 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing
power parity (PPP).[306] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over
the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012,[307] India is one of
the world's fastest-growing economies.[308] However, the country ranks 139th
in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 118th in GDP per capita at
PPP.[309] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies
that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and
regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute
balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its
economy;[310] since then, it has moved increasingly towards a free-market
system[311][312] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment
inflows.[313] India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1
January 1995.[314]

The 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world's second-largest, as
of 2017[update].[295] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial
sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India's foreign exchange
remittances of US$100 billion in 2022,[315] highest in the world, were
contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign
countries.[316] Major agricultural products include rice, wheat, oilseed,
cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[14] Major industries include
textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food
processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery,
and software.[14] In 2006, the share of external trade in India's GDP stood at
24%, up from 6% in 1985.[311] In 2008, India's share of world trade was
1.7%;[317] In 2021, India was the world's ninth-largest importer and the
sixteenth-largest exporter.[318] Major exports include petroleum products,
textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and
manufactured leather goods.[14] Major imports include crude oil, machinery,
gems, fertiliser, and chemicals.[14] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution
of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to
42%.[319] India was the world's second-largest textile exporter after China in
the 2013 calendar year.[320]

Averaging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to
2007,[311] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first
decade of the 21st century.[321] Some 431 million Indians have left poverty
since 1985; India's middle classes are projected to number around 580 million
by 2030.[322] Though ranking 68th in global competitiveness,[323] as of
2010[update], India ranks 17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the
banking sector, 44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead
of several advanced economies.[324] With seven of the world's top 15
information technology outsourcing companies based in India, as of
2009[update], the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing
destination after the United States.[325] India is ranked 40th in the Global
Innovation Index in 2023.[326] As of 2023[update], India's consumer market was
the world's fifth-largest.[327]

Driven by growth, India's nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from
US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an
estimated US$1,730 in 2016. It is expected to grow to US$2,466 by 2022.[18]
However, it has remained lower than those of other Asian developing countries
such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is
expected to remain so in the near future.

In the 1980s, when the first multinational corporations began to set up
centres in India, they chose Bangalore because of the large pool of skilled
graduates in the area, in turn due to the many science and engineering
colleges in the surrounding region.[328]

According to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report, India's GDP at
purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United States by 2045.[329]
During the next four decades, Indian GDP is expected to grow at an annualised
average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy
until 2050.[329] The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly
growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of
rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the
consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle-class.[329] The World Bank
cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue
to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and
rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security,
and public health and nutrition.[330]

According to the Worldwide Cost of Living Report 2017 released by the
Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) which was created by comparing more than 400
individual prices across 160 products and services, four of the cheapest
cities were in India: Bangalore (3rd), Mumbai (5th), Chennai (5th) and New
Delhi (8th).[331]

### Industries

A tea garden in Sikkim. India, the world's second-largest producer of tea, is
a nation of one billion tea drinkers, who consume 70% of India's tea output.

India's telecommunication industry is the second-largest in the world with
over 1.2 billion subscribers. It contributes 6.5% to India's GDP.[332] After
the third quarter of 2017, India surpassed the US to become the second-largest
smartphone market in the world after China.[333]

The Indian automotive industry, the world's second-fastest growing, increased
domestic sales by 26% during 2009–2010,[334] and exports by 36% during
2008–2009.[335] In 2022, India became the world's third-largest vehicle market
after China and the United States, surpassing Japan.[336] At the end of 2011,
the Indian IT industry employed 2.8 million professionals, generated revenues
close to US$100 billion equalling 7.5% of Indian GDP, and contributed 26% of
India's merchandise exports.[337]

The pharmaceutical industry in India emerged as a global player. As of 2021,
with 3000 pharmaceutical companies and 10,500 manufacturing units India is the
world's third-largest pharmaceutical producer, largest producer of generic
medicines and supply up to 50–60% of global vaccines demand, these all
contribute up to US$24.44 billions in exports and India's local pharmaceutical
market is estimated up to US$42 billion.[338][339] India is among the top 12
biotech destinations in the world.[340][341] The Indian biotech industry grew
by 15.1% in 2012–2013, increasing its revenues from ₹204.4 billion (Indian
rupees) to ₹235.24 billion (US$3.94 billion at June 2013 exchange rates).[342]

### Energy

Main articles: Energy in India and Energy policy of India

India's capacity to generate electrical power is 300 gigawatts, of which 42
gigawatts is renewable.[343] The country's usage of coal is a major cause of
greenhouse gas emissions by India but its renewable energy is competing
strongly.[344] India emits about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This
equates to about 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is half
the world average.[345][346] Increasing access to electricity and clean
cooking with liquefied petroleum gas have been priorities for energy in
India.[347]

### Socio-economic challenges

Health workers about to begin another day of immunisation against infectious
diseases in 2006. Eight years later, and three years after India's last case
of polio, the World Health Organization declared India to be polio-free.[348]

Despite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-
economic challenges. In 2006, India contained the largest number of people
living below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per
day.[349] The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005.[350] Under
the World Bank's later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011.[q][352] 30.7%
of India's children under the age of five are underweight.[353] According to a
Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population is
undernourished.[354][355] The Midday Meal Scheme attempts to lower these
rates.[356]

A 2018 Walk Free Foundation report estimated that nearly 8 million people in
India were living in different forms of modern slavery, such as bonded labour,
child labour, human trafficking, and forced begging, among others.[357]
According to the 2011 census, there were 10.1 million child labourers in the
country, a decline of 2.6 million from 12.6 million in 2001.[358]

Since 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown:
the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was
3.2 times that of the poorest.[359] Corruption in India is perceived to have
decreased. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 78th
out of 180 countries in 2018 with a score of 41 out of 100, an improvement
from 85th in 2014.[360][361]

Epidemic and pandemic diseases have long been a major factor, including
COVID-19 and cholera.[362]

With 1,210,193,422 residents reported in the 2011 provisional census
report,[363] India was the world's second-most populous country.[r] Its
population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011,[365] compared to 21.54% growth in
the previous decade (1991–2001).[365] The human sex ratio, according to the
2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males.[363] The median age was 28.7 as
of 2020[update].[295] The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951,
counted 361 million people.[366] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as
well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the "Green
Revolution" have caused India's population to grow rapidly.[367]

The life expectancy in India is 70 years—71.5 years for women, 68.7 years for
men.[295] There are around 93 physicians per 100,000 people.[368] Migration
from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in India's recent
history. The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991
and 2001.[369] Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural areas.[370][371]
The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to
31.16% in the 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall population growth
rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since
1991.[372] According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban
agglomerations in India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai,
Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population.[373]
The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among
males.[374] The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in
2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural
literacy rate is twice that of urban areas.[372] Kerala is the most literate
state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%.[374]

believed to have been introduced to India by the late 2nd century by Syriac-
speaking Christians.

There are several hundred languages of India. About 74% of Indians speak Indo-
Aryan languages, the easternmost branch of the Indo-European languages; 24%
speak Dravidian languages, indigenous to South Asia and spoken widely before
the spread of Indo-Aryan languages and 2% speak Austroasiatic languages or the
Sino-Tibetan languages. India has no national language.[375] Hindi, with the
largest number of speakers, is the official language of the
government.[376][377] English is used extensively in business and
administration and has the status of a "subsidiary official language";[6] it
is important in education, especially as a medium of higher education. Each
state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the
constitution recognises in particular 22 "scheduled languages".

The 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest number of
followers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population), followed by Islam (14.23%);
the remaining were Christianity (2.30%), Sikhism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%),
Jainism (0.36%) and others[s] (0.9%).[13] India has the third-largest Muslim
population—the largest for a non-Muslim majority country.[378][379]

## Culture

Main article: Culture of India

A Sikh pilgrim at the Harmandir Sahib, or Golden Temple, in Amritsar, Punjab

Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[380] During the Vedic
period (c. 1700 BCE – c. 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy,
mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices
which still exist today, such as _dhárma_ , _kárma_ , _yóga_ , and _mokṣa_ ,
were established.[75] India is notable for its religious diversity, with
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the
nation's major religions.[381] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been
shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the
_Upanishads_ ,[382] the _Yoga Sutras_ , the _Bhakti_ movement,[381] and by
Buddhist philosophy.[383]

### Visual art

Main article: Indian art

India has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences
with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist
art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last
also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[384] Thousands of seals from the Indus
Valley Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually
carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The "Pashupati" seal,
excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best known.[385][386]
After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[386][387]
Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of
religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably
originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the
first imperial movement.[388][389][390] In the first millennium CE, Buddhist
art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last
also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[391] Over the following centuries a
distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less
interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but
showing smoothly flowing forms expressing _prana_ ("breath" or life-
force).[392][393] This is often complicated by the need to give figures
multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right
of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.[394][395]

Most of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from
Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati,[396] or is rock cut
reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear
rather later.[397][398] In spite of this complex mixture of religious
traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has
been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually
served all communities.[399] Gupta art, at its peak c. 300 CE – c. 500 CE, is
often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many
centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the
Elephanta Caves.[400][401] Across the north, this became rather stiff and
formulaic after c. 800 CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the
surrounds of statues.[402] But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola
dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great
achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic
symbol of India.[403][404]

Ancient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes
of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the most important, but it was
evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in
Gupta times.[405][406] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from
Eastern India about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being
Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in larger
paintings.[407] The Persian-derived Deccan painting, starting just before the
Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting,
with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and
wars.[408][409] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the
Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the
most innovative, with figures such as Nihâl Chand and Nainsukh.[410][411] As a
market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting
by Indian artists with considerable Western influence.[412][413] In the 19th
century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper,
were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art,
reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in
modern Indian painting.[414][415]

### Architecture

Much of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Indo-
Islamic Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, blends ancient
local traditions with imported styles.[416] Vernacular architecture is also
regional in its flavours. _Vastu shastra_ , literally "science of
construction" or "architecture" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan,[417] explores
how the laws of nature affect human dwellings;[418] it employs precise
geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic
constructs.[419] As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by
the _Shilpa Shastras_ , a series of foundational texts whose basic
mythological form is the _Vastu-Purusha mandala_ , a square that embodied the
"absolute".[420] The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders
of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the
UNESCO World Heritage List as "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the
universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage".[421] Indo-Saracenic
Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew
on Indo-Islamic architecture.[422]

### Literature

Main article: Indian literature

The earliest literature in India, composed between 1500 BCE and 1200 CE, was
in the Sanskrit language.[423] Major works of Sanskrit literature include the
_Rigveda_ (c. 1500 BCE – c. 1200 BCE), the epics: _Mahābhārata_ (c. 400 BCE –
c. 400 CE) and the _Ramayana_ (c. 300 BCE and later); _Abhijñānaśākuntalam_
(_The Recognition of Śakuntalā_), and other dramas of Kālidāsa (c. 5th century
CE) and _Mahākāvya_ poetry.[424][425][426] In Tamil literature, the Sangam
literature (c. 600 BCE – c. 300 BCE) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by
473 poets, is the earliest work.[427][428][429][430] From the 14th to the 18th
centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change
because of the emergence of devotional poets like Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and Guru
Nānak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought
and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed
significantly from classical traditions.[431] In the 19th century, Indian
writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological
descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the
works of the Bengali poet, author and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore,[432]
who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.

### Performing arts and media

Main articles: Music of India, Dance in India, Cinema of India, and Television
in India

India's National Academy of Performance Arts has recognised eight Indian dance
styles to be _classical_. One such is Kuchipudi shown here.

Indian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical
music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern
Hindustani and the southern Carnatic schools.[433] Regionalised popular forms
include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the _bauls_ is a
well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and
classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are: _bhangra_ of Punjab,
_bihu_ of Assam, _Jhumair_ and _chhau_ of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal,
_garba_ and _dandiya_ of Gujarat, _ghoomar_ of Rajasthan, and _lavani_ of
Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological
elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India's National
Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. These are: _bharatanatyam_ of the state of
Tamil Nadu, _kathak_ of Uttar Pradesh, _kathakali_ and _mohiniyattam_ of
Kerala, _kuchipudi_ of Andhra Pradesh, _manipuri_ of Manipur, _odissi_ of
Odisha, and the _sattriya_ of Assam.[434]

Theatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.[435]
Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or
social and political events, Indian theatre includes: the _bhavai_ of Gujarat,
the _jatra_ of West Bengal, the _nautanki_ and _ramlila_ of North India,
_tamasha_ of Maharashtra, _burrakatha_ of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana,
_terukkuttu_ of Tamil Nadu, and the _yakshagana_ of Karnataka.[436] India has
a theatre training institute the National School of Drama (NSD) that is
situated at New Delhi. It is an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of
culture, Government of India.[437] The Indian film industry produces the
world's most-watched cinema.[438] Established regional cinematic traditions
exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi,
Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, and Telugu languages.[439] The Hindi language
film industry (_Bollywood_) is the largest sector representing 43% of box
office revenue, followed by the South Indian Telugu and Tamil film industries
which represent 36% combined.[440]

Television broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of
communication and expanded slowly for more than two decades.[441][442] The
state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s. Since then,
satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian
society.[443] Today, television is the most penetrative media in India;
industry estimates indicate that as of 2012[update] there are over 554 million
TV consumers, 462 million with satellite or cable connections compared to
other forms of mass media such as the press (350 million), radio (156 million)
or internet (37 million).[444]

### Society

Traditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The
Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the
social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are
defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as _jātis_
, or "castes".[445] India abolished untouchability in 1950 with the adoption
of the constitution and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and
social welfare initiatives.

Family values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational
patrilineal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear
families are becoming common in urban areas.[446] An overwhelming majority of
Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or
other family elders.[447] Marriage is thought to be for life,[447] and the
divorce rate is extremely low,[448] with less than one in a thousand marriages
ending in divorce.[449] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas;
many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.[450]
Female infanticide in India, and lately female foeticide, have created skewed
gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from 15
million to 63 million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster than the
population growth during the same period, and constituting 20 percent of
India's female electorate.[451] According to an Indian government study, an
additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate
care.[452] Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice
remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a
patriarchal society.[453] The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains
widespread across class lines.[454] Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from
bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.[455]

Many Indian festivals are religious in origin. The best known include Diwali,
Ganesh Chaturthi, Thai Pongal, Holi, Durga Puja, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id,
Christmas, and Vaisakhi.[456][457]

### Education

in the Indian subcontinent

jurist, social reformer, and Dalit leader B. R. Ambedkar.

In the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men
and 65% for women. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%,
53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12%
and 2%. In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%,[458][459] According to Latika
Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten
villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private
spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its
growth.[460]

The education system of India is the world's second-largest.[461] India has
over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges[462] and 1.5 million schools.[463] In
India's higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved
under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged. In
recent decades India's improved education system is often cited as one of the
main contributors to its economic development.[464][465]

### Clothing

From ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn
traditional dress in India was draped.[466] For women it took the form of a
sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long.[466] The sari was traditionally
wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder.[466] In its modern form, it is
combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band
for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or
choli, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end—passing
over the shoulder—serving to cover the midriff and obscure the upper body's
contours.[466] For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has
served as a lower-body garment.[467]

jeans and sweater, and pink shalwar kameez

The use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was
established at first by the Delhi sultanate (c. 1300 CE) and then continued by
the Mughal Empire (c. 1525 CE).[468] Among the garments introduced during this
time and still commonly worn are: the shalwars and pyjamas, both styles of
trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez.[468] In southern India, the
traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.[468]

Shalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They
are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the
waist.[469] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow,
on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. When they are ordinarily
wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called
pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,[470] its side seams left open
below the waist-line.[471] The kurta is traditionally collarless and made of
cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as
chikan; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer's
knees.[472]

In the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India.
Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of
everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.[473] The
traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour
churidars or jeans.[473] In white-collar office settings, ubiquitous air
conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.[473] For weddings
and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often wear
bandgala, or short Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen
sporting sherwanis and churidars.[473] The dhoti, once the universal garment
of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi
allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,[474] is seldom
seen in the cities.[473]

### Cuisine

Main article: Indian cuisine

South Indian vegetarian thali, or platter

Railway mutton curry from Odisha

The foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion
and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[475] The cooked cereal could
be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread made from wheat flour, or
occasionally cornmeal, and griddle-cooked dry;[476] the idli, a steamed
breakfast cake, or dosa, a griddled pancake, both leavened and made from a
batter of rice- and gram meal.[477] The savoury dishes might include lentils,
pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic, but also with a
combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon,
cardamon and others as informed by culinary conventions.[475] They might also
include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients
might be mixed during the process of cooking.[478]

A platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for
the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments,
which are often served in small bowls. The cereal and its accompaniments are
eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is accomplished by
mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or folding, wrapping, scooping or
dipping—such as chapati and cooked vegetables or lentils.[475]

A tandoor chef in the Turkman Gate, Old Delhi, makes Khameeri roti (a Muslim-
influenced style of leavened bread).[479]

India has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical
and cultural histories of its adherents.[480] The appearance of _ahimsa_ , or
the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders
early in Indian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and
Jainism, is thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism
among a large segment of India's Hindu population, especially in southern
India, Gujarat, the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India, as well as
among Jains.[480] Although meat is eaten widely in India, the proportional
consumption of meat in the overall diet is low.[481] Unlike China, which has
increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of
increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have
contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal
protein consumption.[482]

The most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last
millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire. Dishes such as the pilaf,[483]
developed in the Abbasid caliphate,[484] and cooking techniques such as the
marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its
northwest.[485] To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic,
almonds, and spices began to be added in India.[485] Rice was partially cooked
and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and
slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what
has today become the Indian biryani,[485] a feature of festive dining in many
parts of India.[486] In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide the
diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of
Punjabi cuisine. The popularity of tandoori chicken—cooked in the tandoor
oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab
and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally from
Central Asia—dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an
entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced
by the 1947 partition of India.[480]

### Sports and recreation

Main article: Sport in India

Girls play hopscotch in Jaora, Madhya Pradesh. Hopscotch has been commonly
played by girls in rural India.[487]

Several traditional indigenous sports such as _kabaddi_ , _kho kho_ ,
_pehlwani_ and _gilli-danda_ , and also martial arts such as _Kalarippayattu_
and _marma adi_ , remain popular. Chess is commonly held to have originated in
India as _chaturaṅga_ ;[488] in recent years, there has been a rise in the
number of Indian grandmasters.[489] Viswanathan Anand became the Chess World
Champion in 2007 and held the title until 2013. He also won the Chess World
Cup in 2000 and 2002. In 2023, 18-year-old R Praggnanandhaa finished as
runner-up in the Chess World Cup 2023.[490] Parcheesi is derived from
_Pachisi_ , another traditional Indian pastime, which in early modern times
was played on a giant marble court by Mughal emperor Akbar the Great.[491] The
tabletop game carrom, which originated in India, is also very popular.[492]

Cricket is the most popular sport in India.[493] Major domestic leagues
include the Indian Premier League. Professional leagues in other sports
include the Indian Super League (football) and the Pro Kabaddi
league.[494][495][496]

India has won two Cricket World Cups, the 1983 edition and the 2011 edition,
as well as becoming the inaugural T20 World Cup Champions in 2007. India has
also won the Champions Trophy twice, in 2002 and 2013. The only edition of the
World Championship of Cricket was won by India in 1985.

India also has eight field hockey gold medals in the summer olympics.[497] The
improved results garnered by the Indian Davis Cup team and other tennis
players in the early 2010s have made tennis increasingly popular in the
country.[498] India has a comparatively strong presence in shooting sports,
and has won several medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting Championships,
and the Commonwealth Games.[499][500] Other sports in which Indians have
succeeded internationally include badminton[501] (Saina Nehwal and P. V.
Sindhu are two of the top-ranked female badminton players in the world),
boxing,[502] and wrestling.[503] Football is popular in West Bengal, Goa,
Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states. India has traditionally been
the dominant country at the South Asian Games. An example of this dominance is
the basketball competition, where the Indian team won four out of five
tournaments to date.[504][505]

India has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events: the 1951
and 1982 Asian Games; the 1987, 1996, 2011 and 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World
Cup tournaments (and is also scheduled to host it in 2031); the 1978, 1997 and
2013 ICC Women's Cricket World Cup tournaments (and is also scheduled to host
it in 2025); the 1987, 1985 and 2016 South Asian Games; the 1990-91 Men's Asia
Cup; the 2002 Chess World Cup; the 2003 Afro-Asian Games; the 2006 ICC Cricket
Champion's Trophy (and is also scheduled to host it in 2029); the 2006 Women's
Asia Cup; the 2009 World Badminton Championships; the 2010 Hockey World Cup;
the 2010 Commonwealth Games; the 2016 ICC Men's Cricket T20 World Cup (and is
also scheduled to host it in 2026); the 2016 ICC Women's Cricket T20 World
Cup; and the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Major international sporting events
held annually in India include the Maharashtra Open, the Mumbai Marathon, the
Delhi Half Marathon, and the Indian Masters. The first Formula 1 Indian Grand
Prix featured in late 2011 but has been discontinued from the F1 season
calendar since 2014.[506]

The Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without the use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was formalised early on. This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is in fact something of a _tape-recording_ of ca. 1500–500 BCE. Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present. (pp. 68–69) ...

(c) Ludden 2014, p. 19, "In Punjab, a dry region with grasslands watered by
five rivers (hence 'panch' and 'ab') draining the western Himalayas, one
prehistoric culture left no material remains, but some of its ritual texts
were preserved orally over the millennia. The culture is called Aryan, and
evidence in its texts indicates that it spread slowly south-east, following
the course of the Yamuna and Ganga Rivers. Its elite called itself Arya (pure)
and distinguished themselves sharply from others. Aryans led kin groups
organized as nomadic horse-herding tribes. Their ritual texts are called
Vedas, composed in Sanskrit. Vedic Sanskrit is recorded only in hymns that
were part of Vedic rituals to Aryan gods. To be Aryan apparently meant to
belong to the elite among pastoral tribes. Texts that record Aryan culture are
not precisely datable, but they seem to begin around 1200 BCE with four
collections of Vedic hymns (Rg, Sama, Yajur, and Artharva)."  
(d) Dyson 2018, pp. 14–15, "Although the collapse of the Indus valley
civilization is no longer believed to have been due to an 'Aryan invasion' it
is widely thought that, at roughly the same time, or perhaps a few centuries
later, new Indo-Aryan-speaking people and influences began to enter the
subcontinent from the north-west. Detailed evidence is lacking. Nevertheless,
a predecessor of the language that would eventually be called Sanskrit was
probably introduced into the north-west sometime between 3,900 and 3,000 years
ago. This language was related to one then spoken in eastern Iran; and both of
these languages belonged to the Indo-European language family. ... It seems
likely that various small-scale migrations were involved in the gradual
introduction of the predecessor language and associated cultural
characteristics. However, there may not have been a tight relationship between
movements of people on the one hand, and changes in language and culture on
the other. Moreover, the process whereby a dynamic new force gradually arose—a
people with a distinct ideology who eventually seem to have referred to
themselves as 'Arya'—was certainly two-way. That is, it involved a blending of
new features which came from outside with other features—probably including
some surviving Harappan influences—that were already present. Anyhow, it would
be quite a few centuries before Sanskrit was written down. And the hymns and
stories of the Arya people—especially the Vedas and the later Mahabharata and
Ramayana epics—are poor guides as to historical events. Of course, the
emerging Arya were to have a huge impact on the history of the subcontinent.
Nevertheless, little is known about their early presence.";  
(e) Robb 2011, pp. 46–, "The expansion of Aryan culture is supposed to have
begun around 1500 BCE. It should not be thought that this Aryan emergence
(though it implies some migration) necessarily meant either a sudden invasion
of new peoples, or a complete break with earlier traditions. It comprises a
set of cultural ideas and practices, upheld by a Sanskrit-speaking elite, or
Aryans. The features of this society are recorded in the Vedas."

Geographical location, personal and popular sentiment, and substantial pressure and incentives from the new governments led almost all princes eventually to merge their domains into either Pakistan or India. ... Each new government asserted its exclusive sovereignty within its borders, realigning all territories, animals, plants, minerals, and all other natural and human-made resources as either Pakistani or Indian property, to be used for its national development... Simultaneously, the central civil and military services and judiciary split roughly along religious 'communal' lines, even as they divided movable government assets according to a negotiated formula: 22.7 percent for Pakistan and 77.3 percent for India."

She also demonstrates that the new national states of India and Pakistan were quickly drawn into trying to stem this migration. As they put into place laws designed to restrict the return of partition emigrants, this produced new dilemmas for both new nations in their treatment of 'overseas Indians'; and many of them lost their right to return to their places of origin in the subcontinent, and also their claims to full citizenship in host countries."

Growth is limited only by moisture availability in these areas, so with irrigation the fertile alluvial soil of Punjab and Haryana has been turned into India's prime agricultural area. Much of the thorn forest covering the plains probably had savannah-like features now no longer visible.

This is not merely a reflection of the growth in the overall population, but, rather, of the fact that this dangerous trend has worsened with time. As a percentage of the female electorate, missing women have gone up significantly — from 13 per cent to approximately 20 per cent"

The skewed ratio of men to women is largely the result of sex-selective abortions, and better nutrition and medical care for boys, according to the government's annual economic survey, which was released on Monday. In addition, the survey found that "families where a son is born are more likely to stop having children than families where a girl is born".

Idli cakes are soft, moist and spongy, have desirable sour flavour, and is eaten as breakfast in South India. Dosa batter is very similar to idli batter, except that both the rice and black gram are finely grounded. The batter is thinner than that of idli and is fried as a thin, crisp pancake and eaten directly in South India."

In this manner, Central Asian cooking merged with older traditions within the subcontinent, to create such signature dishes as biryani (a fusion of the Persian pilau and the spice-laden dishes of Hindustan), and the Kashmiri meat stew of Rogan Josh. It not only generated new dishes and entire cuisines, but also fostered novel modes of eating. Such newer trends included the consumption of Persian condiments, which relied heavily on almonds, pastries and quince jams, alongside Indian achars made from sweet limes, green vegetables and curds as side relishes during Mughlai meals."
